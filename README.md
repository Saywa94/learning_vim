# learning_vim

Hi,

This repository hold documents related with me tipping my toes on Vim and the coding world.
It probably contains the following files :
- [My vimrc](.vimrc): which contains my vim config and optimizations
- My [Windows Terminal config](windows_terminal_config.json)

I'm also learning to use git and github. So if I'm doing this all worng. I'm sorry.
