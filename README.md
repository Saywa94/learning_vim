# learning_vim

Hi,

This repository hold documents related with me tipping my toes on Vim and the coding world.
It probably contains the following files :
- [My vimrc](.vimrc): which contains my vim config and optimizations. For it to work you need to install:
  - [Vim-Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
  - If on linux: 
    - open the vimrc and save it using the following command :
    `:w ++ff=unix`
    close it and then open Vim again.
    - Install npm
  - Nodejs (For Coc.vim to work)
- My [Windows Terminal config](windows_terminal_config.json)

I'm also learning to use git and github. So if I'm doing this all worng. I'm sorry.
